## Aliasing Python (Have Homebrew manage Python 3)

alias pip3 and python3


```
Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.8/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin/pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python

python@3.8 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have python@3.8 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find python@3.8 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/lib"

For pkg-config to find python@3.8 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/lib/pkgconfig"

==> python@3.9
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
```
